### Project Motivation

For this project I was interested in analysing the Airbnb Seattle data for customer booking and pricing, popularity of listings with respect to its facilities.
The project involved below steps:

* Loading and cleaning a small subset of .csv raw data provided.

* Conducting Data Wragling, Analysis and visualizations to understand the data and what features are useful for property trend analysis.

* Modelling using sklearn library while using Linear Regression algorithm to predict the rental pricing and impact from some features. 
  
### File Descriptions

There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work in detailed analysis along with resolving three questions supported with statistical results. 
Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

### Medium Blog Post

The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@anand-blog/data-science-blog-1ead4fd41e5) explaining the technical details of my project. Besides basic data modelling, analysis and visualizations, Linear Regression  was used to find the pricing impact over location of the listings.

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Project Motivation

Motivated to analysing insights on Airbnb Seattle open data from popular data platform - Kaggle for customer booking, pricing and popularity of listings.
Further psowith respect to its facilities. Eventually the goal is to  to draw conclusions from the data and try to tackle some of the questions/hypothesis.
Relying on principles of Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), we try to answer the following questions with the help of data analysis:
1. What are the most common amenities?
2. What are the prominent features contributing to highly rented properties?
3. How much price differs with the distance from city center / downtown? 

Business Understanding
Data Understanding
Prepare Data
Data Modeling
Evaluate the Results

The project involved below steps:

* Loading and cleaning a small subset of .csv raw data provided.

* Conducting Data Wrangling, Analysis and Visualizations to understand the data and what features are useful for property trend analysis.

* Modelling using sklearn library while using Linear Regression algorithm to predict the rental pricing impacted by some features. 
  
### Medium Blog Post

The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@anand-blog/data-science-blog-1ead4fd41e5) explaining the technical details of my project. Besides basic data modelling, analysis and visualizations, Linear Regression  was used to find the pricing impact over location of the listings.
